# TODOs for Neovim

## Toolbar

1. Disable pinguin, encoding and box?
2. enable indentation
3. maybe add system monitor (as in VSCode)

## Tabout

- Apply tabout plugin

## Theme

- Save selected theme as default, so the next time nvim starts, the previous selected theme gets loaded

## indentation

- Fix indentation configs, so the spaces are visible as dots

## Icons

- Add a more beautiful icon pack
